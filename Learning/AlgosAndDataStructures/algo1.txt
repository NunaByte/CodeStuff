//Palindrome Number Checker
convert number to string
while low index is less than high index, check if string at first index is not equal to string at second index, if so it is not a palindrome
Otherwise increment the low index and decrement the high index



//Array has duplicate

sort array
loop through array
if current index is equal to current index+1 return true



//Disappeared in an array

Create set for unique array list
Copy array elements into set
check if any numbers are not present in the set


// Plus Minus
loop through array
track how many numbers are less than 0
track how many numbers are greater than 0
track how many numbers are equal to 0

// Rotate array of size n by d elements
